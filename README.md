🧠 Image Classification using CNN (CIFAR-10)
This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It classifies small RGB images (32x32) into 10 categories such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

📌 Features
🔍 Classifies 32x32 color images into 10 classes

🧠 CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras

💾 Trained on 20,000 CIFAR-10 images, tested on 4,000

🖼️ Accepts custom 32x32 images for prediction

💾 Model saved and reloaded using .keras format

📊 Shows prediction results with matplotlib
